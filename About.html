                <h1>Hi, I'm Abigail Buchwald</h1>
            <h3 id="p1">I'm a graphic designer based in the Boston area.</h3>
            <p id="p2"> I grew up in Colorado and North Carolina, and have studied at Gordon College and Lesley University. My parents knew I would go into design before I did; my mom always tells this story about me drawing a wooden model as a ballerina at a children's area in an art museum when I was about five years old. A worker came up to my mother and said, “I have never seen a child so focused on what they are making”. My mom claims that was the point she knew I would go into a creative field. I initially had aspirations of going into Physics or Engineering, but then realized how deeply engrained creativity is in my daily life. Graphic design has been the perfect field between visual creation and analytical, mathematical design. I have more of an extensive background in visual art, as well as environmental science and a long lost mathematics major from back in the day. I hope to implement my various areas of expertise into my work going forward.</p>
            <h3>I have an extensive background in various forms of visual art and design, including:</h3>
