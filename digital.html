        <h4>I was the co-director of Gordon College's student design agency in 2021. This responsibility meant being a liaison between student designers and clients, organizing meetings and events, managing social media accounts, assisting students with access to design platforms, and critiquing projects. I also took projects from time to time, and worked closely with students and faculty to execute their vision. </h4>
